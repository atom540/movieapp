- **Home Screen**: Displays a list of movies in a Netflix-like grid.
- **Search Screen**: Allows users to search for movies.
- **Details Screen**: Displays detailed information about a selected movie, including a large movie poster, title, and summary. If no image is available, a default image is displayed.
